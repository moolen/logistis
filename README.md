User Interaction Tracking for Kubernetes.

Logistis is an application which observes **user interaction** with a Kubernetes cluster. Think `Google Analytics for Kubernetes`.
It tracks CRUD operations via ValidatingWebhook and stores it in its own local database.
The tracking events can be fetched as `json` or shown as `diff`.

It allows you to:
* track who made a change in which namespace to which resource
* track what changes have been made and when
* get an overview of recent changes in a cluster

> Yes, everyone does gitops. But people still need to operate their stuff.

#### TODO/Roadmap
* `kubectl blame` plugin to inspect changes
  * overview on a cluster-global level: latest changes by namespace
  * latest changes per-namespace
* add `/lock` API to lock down namespaces or resources from particular users
* distributed event storage ðŸ¤·
* make event limit configurable (currently max 100 events per resource)

### Quickstart

```
$ make deploy
# ...make changes to a pod or deployment
```

#### fetch events
```
$ curl -k "https://localhost:8888/events" | jq
{
  "apps//Pod/lifespan-seven": [
    {
      "id": "0f5a2222-69a2-43d5-9dbe-85dbc23491fa",
      "group": "",
      "kind": "Pod",
      "namespace": "apps",
      "name": "lifespan-seven",
      "time": "2022-08-12T23:36:30.118019949Z",
      "operation": "UPDATE",
      "userInfo": "&UserInfo{Username:kubernetes-admin,UID:,Groups:[system:masters system:authenticated],Extra:map[string]ExtraValue{},}",
      "object": "...",
      "oldObject": "..."
```

#### show diff
```diff
$ k port-forward svc/simple-kubernetes-webhook 8888:443 &
$ curl -ik "https://localhost:8888/diff?namespace=kube-system"
